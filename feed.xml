<p>Now known as "360 Management" (formally, <strong>Summit Consulting</strong>), <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>even if you think they are your absolute last resort, run... fast!</strong></span> I only renewed my first lease because I didn't want to move during the height of the pandemic. I've been nothing but a respectful, quiet, on-time tenant. I've put my own money and effort into small, but nonetheless, impactful work to the yard and around the house to make it look a bit more presentable. But, the two years in this house have been an absolute hell.</p>
<p>My asthma and allergies have been out of control since moving in November 2019, and I've just felt so run down, and have been getting throat and esophagus infections continuously since June 2020. I always seem to have a headache, I have extreme difficulties concentrating, and have become very forgetful. I've had three EGDs performed over a year with not really any clues as to what was wrong with me. I also started to develop strange chest pains and felt like my heart was pounding out of my chest. I had a full cardiac exam and testing done. EKG, Heart Ultrasound, 2-week heart monitor, and this year, the dreaded exercise stress test. All 100% normal. Then, it hit me, my health declined very quickly after being sent to work from home full time in June 2020, this house is making me sick!</p>

<p>Since the day I moved in I've tried to get management to address cracked ceilings in every room, water stains in one bedroom, and bubbled/crackled drywall on the kitchen ceiling, all written off multiple times as "cosmetic."</p>

<p>Shortly after I moved in, I notified, then, <em><strong>Summit Consulting</strong></em> about the ceilings, and was told they'd look into it, but it was nothing to worry about.  Nobody ever showed up.</p>

<p>After several ignored emails and work orders regarding a wasp infestation inside the old rusted out clothes line poles in the backyard, I sent management a written letter via certified mail so I would have confirmation it was received.  Only to get this response a few weeks later.  <em>(note, the comment about the grass wasn't valid - the photos attached to the written letter were from early Spring and taken during me mowing the lawn)</em></p>

<p>A few months ago, after a long summer of ant infestations, I saw the ants were coming from from the trim along this wall in the utlity room that's underneath a storage shelf.  The wall's paint was peeling away, and I could physically move this section of wall simply by touching it.  The ceiling, also peeling away.</p>

<p>Only after I emailed management (zero response) and put in a high priority maintenance request, did somebody come out and patch the wall. The technician was able to pull the bad drywall off with his hands, as if it was cardboard or paper. The backside of it was covered in a black substance.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://360.myjacobsnetwork.net/img/247091371_10220339707663864_518851306250501861_n.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="" width="2048" height="1536"></figure>
<p>Being the analytical person I am, I knew what I was dealing with, but couldn't just rely on that evidence alone. I had an air quality test, and the levels of mold spores in my kitchen alone were almost off their scale (over 1700 spores/sq meter in just one category) from multiple different mold strains.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://360.myjacobsnetwork.net/img/moldReport.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="" width="861" height="929"></figure>
<p>I also confirmed my findings with a professional mold inspection, and blood tests which showed high antibody counts for 11 out of the 12 spore groups tested.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><a href="https://360.myjacobsnetwork.net/img/Inked245322228_900042487555457_5545832530952734992_n.jpg"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://360.myjacobsnetwork.net/img/Inked245322228_900042487555457_5545832530952734992_n.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="" width="1029" height="1316"></figure></a></p>

<p> </p>
<p>After these findings, I called over and over only to be met with their voicemail. From past experience, I knew leaving a voicemail would be useless. Their phone message advises you to send a text message to their main phone number, so I did. Only days later to be met with "we are exceptionally short staffed right now, how can we help you," after providing my concerns and screenshots of reports, all messages stopped. I have not heard from them since.</p>
<p>On 10/20/21, I sent the above professional mold inspection and receipt to deduct the cost from November 2021's rent via 2-day UPS, signature required.  UPS attempted delivery three times, each time, nobody there to sign for it.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Thankfully, my lease expires 11/30, and needless to say, my intent to vacate has already been submitted. I'm sadly confident they will just paint over anything they find and this house will be back on the market in weeks. Part of me feels guilty for just leaving and not fighting. I do not want some unfortunate family to move in only to fall ill themselves, but I can't stay in this environment any longer. I'm exhausted, I have decided to put my health first and leave this dump behind.</p>
